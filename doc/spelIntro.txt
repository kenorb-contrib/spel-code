SPEL (Speakable Programming for Every Language), is a language
for communication and programming or education of humans and
computers.

Each SPEL variant, has high-precision machine translation to 
all other languages, human and computer alike. 
Note that to learn a variant does take some effort.

Mwak is the core pivot SPEL language, which all the other
languages are translated to and from. It is based on Linguistic
Universals.

, as it is
more regular than the "parent language" it comes from, 
also there may be different ways of saying things,
which conform to regular API's and most common ways something is
said cross-linguistically.   But otherwise it should be easier
to learn than for instance Esperanto, since the parent language
vocabulary is used.
